hypothesis_testing - is form of statistical analysis to say whether conclusion made is not by chance

is is important to check whether whatevr sample we got is not favorable/biased, it is actually represneting entire population/not

when we do hypothesis_testing we conclude abot data is biased/not

terminology:
null hypothesis - nothing is extraordinary, evrything is fair - H0
alternative hypothesis - scientist cliam - H1,Ha

Always take what scientist/researchers claim as alternative hypothesis, the opposite is null

sigificance level:
----------
its accepted level of error
declared with alpha
on what basis we declare it
we choose a sigificance level,it is probability threshold, based on that we reject null hypothesis

in generral, if we reject null hypothesis, alternate hypothesis is accepted

but if we reject null hypothesis, its not guarenteed that we accept alternate hypothesis 

p-value:
----
we calculate p-value, to reject null hypothesis.

 The p value, or probability value, tells you how likely it is that your data could have occurred under the null hypothesis.
 The smaller the p-value, the stronger the likelihood that you should reject the null hypothesis. 
 
 A small p value (<=0.05), you should reject the null hypothesis-
 if pvalue s more than alpha, i.e., accepted lvel of error , chances of failure is more than accepted lvel of error
 -then u accept null hypothesis
 

 
A large p value (>0.05), you should not reject the null hypothesis

the scientist goal is to reject the null hypothesis


making decision:
-----------
critical value approach
p-value approach

type-1 and type-2 error:
-----------------------
type- 1:
----
eg - covid reseracheers ask for funds frm finace dep stating temperature has impact and they want to implant refrigerators

u reject null hypothesis when it is actually true
u send some money from finance dep when it is not true
type-2:
--------
u failed to reject null hypothesis when it is actually false

application of hypothesis testing in ml:
-------------------------
1.in ml, we see whether column is playing significant role/not,
2.also in supervised ml, where we approximate target fn, map inputs to outputs
3.choice of alogorithm(linear regression/ neural n/w)
4. test that assumes data is normally distributed
5. compariosn of two samples

q-q(quantile) plot - to check whether data is nomally distributes/not

One tail Test and Two tail test:
===================================

we are basically looking for =,>,< and based on that we decide
if it has = sign, it can be either more or less,hence can be consider two tail test- so alpha is split on both sides - 0.025
> / < -one tail test- entire alpha is considered - 0.05
