Empirical Rule:
----------------
A normal distribution is where mean,median and mode(all three) is at center

1st standard deviation(s.d) - mu + sigma / mu -sigma
2nd standard deviation(s.d) - mu + 2*sigma / mu - 2*sigma

A normal distribution is a density curve where total area is 100%

there are certain observations infered frm empirical rule- 

68 - the probability that randomly selected area upto 1 s.d is 68%

95 - the probability that randomly selected area upto 2 s.d is 95%

99 - the probability that randomly selected area upto 3 s.d is 99%

remaining %(approx 1 %) is outlier
