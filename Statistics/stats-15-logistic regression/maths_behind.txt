how our model interprets data?

Logistic regression(sigmoid fn):
-----------------


its for statistical binary classification only
we will not rely on this even for multi class, shud be used for two class only

its having a Decision Boundary
y-axis is probability

if probability > 0.5 ->class 1
if probability <0.5 ->class 0

there is a decision boundary at 0.5

as prob cant be more than 1, and not less than 1, it follows sigmoid curve(s-shaped curve)
