1. 2 types of data in stats
    1. Quantitaitve(Numerical) - 1.Discrete
                                2. Continous
        2. Qualitaitve(categorical) - 1. Nominal
                                      2. ordinal
                                      
object datatype means catgeorical
int/float datatype means numerical


1. Quantitaitve(Numerical) - how much

    1.Discrete - counted as whole no - eg- how many projects u complete - can be 2 , nt 2.5
    
    sometimes discrete data can also be used as catgeorical data - if it has finite data, like in cylinder eg, no_of_cylinders is used as categorical
    
    2.Continous - no can be infinite precision - how many hrs u slept - 7hr 45 min - not integer


2. Qualitaitve(categorical) - what type
    1. nominal - no hierarchy - Gender - male,female
        2.ordinal - can make a hierarchy - Satisfaction - very unsatisfied, satisifed
                                            social status -rich, poor

ordinal is required to know, becuase machine just understands numbers
so based on category type - u can give it some no, and accordingly we can take action, like if we want to give priority


varaince and standard devition(s.d)
s.d = sqrt(varaince)


Why S.d and varaince:
just knwing mean is not enough


But s.d and variane is also not enough
we shud know Skewness and Kurtosis - for indepth interpretation


Skewness -
---------
lack of symmetry
symmetrical data - if data looks same on both left and right side of mean

why skewness?
--------------
in ml we are majorly doing prediction
Ml algo gives accurate data if its normally distributed
Many ml models have pre-assumption for data to be symmetrical/normaly disributed
ml alogorithm requires whether data s symmetrical/normally distributed, its easy to apply algorithm
if not then certain steps shud be taken

Bell curve-symetrical distribution is part of daily life - as age increase energy increas , but again in 40s energy will get down

Means left and right wil be equally distributed against peak value

for normal distribution - degree of skewness = 0
df.skew() = 0 

in real examples, degree of skewness will not be zero
so we assume if it is btn range -3 to +3, it degree of skewness will be considered  zero

coefficeinet of skewness:
---------
sk = (mean-mode)/s.d

if no mode is defined

sk = 3(mean-medain)/s.d
--------


Kurtosis:
----------
even if skewness is there we shud check kurtosis
for normal distribution - kutosis will be +3 and -3, but for skewness it is 0
even skewness doesnt give complete knowledge

heavy tail -more outlier

3 kutosis- 
high peak
heavy-tail(more outlier)/light tail
flatness in peaks


convexity of curve - kurtosis

degree of kutosis = +7 to -7 is where we can apply ml model

on a data set, kutosis and skewness shd be checked if it is proper dataset or shud it be modified


----------
if we have 2 peaks on curve - it is multi mode


percentile - gives position
measure of kutosis = (75p-25p)/(90p-10p) => p =percentile

------------------
many ml algorithms depend on normlaity assumptions

if it it is not, we apply transformation approach - Box-cox technique - log,square root. cube root of data set - it will change shape of curve/histogram

5 POINT SUMMARY:
------------
min, max, 25 percentile(1st quartile), 50 percentle(2nd quartile-median), 75 percentile(3rd quartile)

df.describe() - gives all abve things

Box plot -

iqr(inter quartile range) = q3-q1
outliers - q3+1.5iqr - q3-1.5iqr
