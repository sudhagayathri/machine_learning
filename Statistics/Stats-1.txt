50 per syllabus is stats - 50 per ml


interviews - 4 rounds
1 round - basic python and stats
2nd round - basic dataset - what s interpretation - submit in 3,4 hrs
3rd round - project
service industry - retain customers
industry - improve quality
4th round - algorithm concepts-understanding, how good maths and stats  is

45 days - stats + ml
25-30 days - project

extra topics:
Balancing dataset

Stats:(Data Analysis)
Gujarat polling - 7cr population
But they dont collect data from all 7cr , they just took frm 2000 people
and  they make proper descriptive analysis

science of learning frm data - science of making decision in uncertainity

collecting data, organizing, analysing anf making menaingfl conversations with limited data

representation in graph is req - histogram
Gaussian shape, bell curve
Matlplot, searborn - many data that willbe in tabular format, aftr graph it will help us understand problem statement

EDA - Exploratory data analysis - it is using tools like seaborn to visualize etc

outliers?

Stats - Data collection, Evaluation(u cant give descriptive analysis based on accuracy, how we analyse model)

Balanced dataset - 50 are healthy , 80 unhealty
Imbalanced dataset - out of 100 - 90 healthy, 10 unhealthy
accuracy shud not be seen
type 1 error


why stats:
it will give 1st level descriptive analysis

2 types:
1. Descriptive - mean, median, mode - without attemping to draw any inferences
	eg - we will do in 10 samples out of 100
2. Inferential -
	use descriptive here
 use mathematical tools to forecast

vacation in goa - 1 day rent bike , insurance 300
grandfather - 1 cigarette 
may amul ice cream celebrity


there shud not be bias - sampling shud be taken properly	
if we have 100 students - 80 boys, 20 girls
sampling wihtout bias - 10 sqmaples - 8 boys , 2 girls

Central Tendency:
if data has outliers (extreme values) -we have to prefer median else mean

interview:
----------
mean - if 10 per

-----
right skewed
left skewed

mode - on categorical dataset
not a numerical data - missing category
gender

to ask:
take data set - plot graphs- give description
