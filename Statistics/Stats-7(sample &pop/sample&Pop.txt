collection of sample is to interpret something abt larger population

if we want to know cutoff marks of exam, instead of asking all stunts, we select 2 exam centers and get


Random Selection will be one approach to choose sample,here biasness also will be less

For trainign and testing sample also we use random selection approach

a. Probability sampling:
===========================
1.simple random selection - very randomly selected
2.systematic random selection - arrange population in some order, choose random start interval and pick people in regular intervals(with interval of 2 select one)

3.Stratified random sample: incase of imbalanced dataset we must apply this sampling process only

this will ensure training dataset will happen properly
split population in groups, random selection frm each grp

trained and testing sample

ths will help in training model with all types of inputs from different categories

eg - we have 1000 problems, 800 frm algebara, 200 frm calacus

in random smapling there can be chance of dataset not to be balanced, 
if 10% of population is selected, it can choose 95 frm algebara and 5 frm calculus, its not correct, 
the machine training model will not learn abt cacculus properly, and hence its testing model will fail

in real life all samples are unbalanced, hence we have to choose proper sampling approach so that it gets trained on all categories
genrally 80% will be training data and 20% will be testing data


we cannot use this in regressin type of models(find salary etc) - because we cannot/split divide into classes because of continus data
can be used in catgorical type of models

4. cluster sampling- its not for learning, its data mining concept, ther is no training , testing
used in unsupervised machine learning
used in targeted approach

if a marketing person is there, and if they need to speak wit people above 20 years

b.Non Probability sampling:

-----
Confidence level and Margin of Error:
-----
with increase in confidence level, confidence interval also increases

candy example:
choose how many candies are there in box

exactly 500 - confidence level will be around 60%
if it is said btn 400 to 500  -confidence level can be around 70%
if it is said btn 300 to 500  -confidence level can be around 80%
if it is said btn 200 to 500  -confidence level can be around 90%

here as u increase the range on the left side(confidence interval) , the confidence level increases

so as confidence interval increases, confidence level increases


confidence interval = point estimate +/- margin of error

if mean is 490, margin of error is 20, ci is betwen 470 to 510

point estimate- nothing but sample mean

there is no influence of size of population on the above

with increase in z-table, margin of error increases, confidence level increases, confidence interval also increases
