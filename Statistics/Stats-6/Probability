stochastic:

with large no of trails the machine will able to predict the probability distribution

- the probability of getting head wil be 0.5 in 1lakhh trials
but in first 10 ,it can be 0.8


probability and likelihood:
population and sample
probabaility - chance that a particular outcome can happen
we expect out of 10 trails head probability - 0.5

but when we picked sample out of 10 - head occurence is 1, 9 tail occurences
then likelihood of this sample is biased/unfair
we validate the event with probability- whether it matches/not

likelihood is used in ml, we predict some data, but likelihood refer to what output we get actually

Probability is used to finding the chance of occurrence of a particular situation, whereas Likelihood is used to generally maximizing the chances of a particular situation to occur.


conditional probability:
ex - the probability of scoring 90% overall after knwing per of one subject out of total 2

Bayes theorem - extension of conditional probability
-----------
spam detection/sarcastic comments- we use Naive Bayes theorem

bag of words model - 

probability of email being spam will be some value
but if email has some spam words like lottery etc, the probabity of email to be spam will change

so probability of email to be spam after knowing it has word lottery is conditional probability

we can have many assumptions(events) like words(p(A/B)), length of email(p(A/c)) etc which can change of probability of email
these events can be considered independent

-----------
in logistic regression- likelihood concept is used
