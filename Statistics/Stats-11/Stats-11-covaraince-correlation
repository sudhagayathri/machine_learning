correlation:
---------
how one varaible will behaves with another

qq plot?



linear relationship:
most of observations wil fall in near or on straightline

1.Strong postitive linear relationship: approx pearson coffieicint of coorelation - +0.92
good pearson coffieicint of coorelation - +1

2.Strong negative linear relationship: while one varaible increases other decreases - 
approx pearson coffieicint of coorelation - -0.92
good pearson coffieicint of coorelation - -1
with no of years price of car decreasing


3.weak linear relationship: points are far away/non-linear
not easily predictable
approx pearson coffieicint of coorelation - 0

4. non-linear relationship: x^2

    curved shape/parabola

5. monotonic relationship: it goes in same direction but not in constant rate


covaraince and correlation:
covaraince- tells direction btn 2 numerical data
-----------
eg- height and weight

limitation: it doesnt tell about strngth of relationship 

correlation:
it provides direction along with strnght of relation
if degree of correlation is +1 - linear postive
if degree of correlation is -1 - linear postive
if degree of correlation is 0 - non linear

------
Any normal distriution/ symmetrical data will come under linear relationship
--
pearson vs  spearman correlation coeffiefcint:
--------
if both columns data distribution is symmenttrical then we use pearson , it gives good results else spearman
if data is not normally distributed its better to use spearman approach


scale of correlation coeefieicnet:
it ranges from 0 to 1

if correlation coeefieicnet btn 2 columns >=0.9, 
its high degree of muti collinearity
---------------------------------
it means both columns give same information, we can drop one, this is concept of feature engineering


df.corr()


variance inflation factor(vif):

vif >=10, that particular column has high multi collinearity with any one column in dataset
it atleast gives that half data, it doesnt say with which it have


diff btn degree of correlation and vif:
degree of correlation  gives complete idea about how one column has correlation with other
vif just says that particular column has high multi collinearity with other column
vif will be useful with dataset having high columns, drop columns test accuracy, if it doesnt chnage
