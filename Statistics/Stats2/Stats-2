Mean, median doesnt give complete idea abt data set
eg - class of 100 students, if avg score is 80 , it doesnt give idea what is lowest score

Hence we go for Standard Deviation

Dispersion/spread:
---------------
Standard Deviation ===> avg dst btn each quantity and mean value
How much data is deviated from mean value
if S.D is low, points are close and dispersion is not much and viceversa
eg - in class mean is 80, but least score is 10 , S.D is high

Best approach is S.D shud be low
if there r 2 pizza companies, with their delivery times
1st pizza - min time - 5, mean - 50, max- 90
2st pizza - min time - 20, mean - 50, max- 70

in this case, we will prefer 2nd pizza
might be 1st can deliver in min 5 min, but in worst case it can take 90 min


Sample and Population:

Standard Deviation formula:

formulas:
--------------
sample - 100 out of 8000
Population - all 8000 data

sample - s=  sqrt((summation(X-x_)^2)/n-1)
Population - sigma =  sqrt((summation(X-x_)^2)/N)

X- each individal value
x_ - mean
n/N  -total observations

degree of freedom - no of try/attributes to complete calculation

Question:
--------
1. why sample is divided by n-1, instead of n

to reduce the bias, we will just use one less degree of freedom
eg - if we have 10 samples, and mean is 80, while calculating standard deviation we will exclude one sample
because while making any samples there can be any bias while bias
while doing this (n-1) so that we make it close to Population


Varaince:
----------
s2=sqrt((summation(X-x_)^2)/n-1)
sigma =  sqrt((summation(X-x_)^2)/N)

variance is just square of value of s.d

variance is just like s.d, it will minimalise n
