DS  consists of below things- 
----------------
Statical modelling - Data analysis
ML - predictive analysis
Deep Learning - predictive analysis
Text analytics and NLP - 
    Text analytics - which deals with text data
NLP - Natural language - Eg - Alexa, Home

Computer vision - Recomendation of netflix, 
IOT- self drive car
Artifical intelligence - it can do many things which ml or nlp cannot do

for anything, Statical modelling and ML is base things
if we want to work in prime,netflix, hotstar computer vision

-----------
Decision Tree / Classification Technique - 
        CHAID
        CART
        C4.5
only cart algorithm is mostly used    


CART(Classification & Regression Tree) is mostly used in industry

Classfication:
------------
when we are classifying based on shared quality

why classify? 
---
To Explain
To Predict


Skill, Expereince, Hire - yes/no
if we are given dataset, we get trained/ explaining/ profiling is done - here algorithm is learning

when we do predictions based on learning, this is classification
-----------

win back campaigns  - hdfc bank giving voucher
here we make a decision tree to identify potential customers

why this cannot be achieved thr normal programming:
----------
we have to identify what shud be the first split
we shud know domain knowledge

But in  ml the algorithm knows the above things through historical data

--
Any node which dont have child node is called a leaf node
----------
CART:

GINI GAIN:
---
cart uses gini gain to know which varaible shud be considered for first split

for whcih node gini gain is high, that will be considered for split first

for EACH SPLIT AGAIN GINI GAIN SHUD BE CALCULATED

AS WE KEEP ON PARTITONING DATA AGAIN AND AGAIN BASED ON GINI GAIN - THE ALGIRITHM IS CALLED RECURSIVE PARTIONING ALGORITHM

Sometimes based on use case some variables will be dropped , some shud be retained
for banking sector/credit card, religion shud be dropped
for food product company religon shud be considereed - beef cannnot be recommended to hindu

for ecommerce gender s important varaible


how frequently we update model depends on domain
for entertaining domain like netflix - ever day
for banking - every 6 minths
for ecommerce - every 15 days

---------

predictions
actual value

80% training 20% testing

testing accuracy
training accuracy - can be less than 100%

Can training accuracy be less than testing accuracy?
yes
--
will always training accuracy be 100%?
no

random sampling will be done through train_test_split
----------

sklearnmodel - DecisionTreeSimplifier

DecisionTreeSimplifier - criteria=Gini - does Gini calculations

max_depth will specify lenght and size of tree - deals with level
min_sample_split=100
hw many minium samples/observations are requied to do gini gain/further split

min_sample_leaf= if any node having number of observations equal to this, make it leaf node, we cant split further

min_sample_leaf, min_sample_split, max_depth works in conjunction


default - min_sample_leaf=100, min_sample_split=100, criteria=Gini
--------------

Loss, Response Rate
------------
Target=1 => Response Rate
Class - majority observations in which targe  -0/1
--------

OVERFITTING AND UNDER FITING- Hyper parameter
-----
label encoding -binary and ordinal encoding


remaining in notes
