---------
box plot - visual representation of 5 point summary
5 point summary - numerical respresentation of box plot

it simply gives about range/distribution of data
5 point summary - mathemticl representation of box plot
5 point summary - median, upper quartile, lower quartile, max, min
median= 50% = average = q2=central value

for even no median is average of 2 middle values

25% - lower quartile = first half center = q1
75% - upper quartile = second half center = q3

while drawing boxplot, we have to take a scale and draw

outlier - which affects central tendency of any distribution
