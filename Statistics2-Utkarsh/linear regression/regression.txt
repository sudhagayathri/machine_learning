data can have target variable, no target variable


Supervised-  if it has target varaible
           - Clasification - target variable is discrete - Eg: Decision Tree, random Forest, Logistic Regression
           - Regression - target variable is continous  - Eg: Linear Regression, ANN

unSupervised-  if it has NO target varaible

Evaluation metrics will be changed for Classification (Accurqacy,Auc, confusion matrix) and regression and unsupervised also


linear regression:
---------
best fit line is where actual and predicted difference is less.

for model know best fit line - it needs to calculate RSS(Residual sum of squares)

RSS = summation(sqr(Act - Pred))

Pred = w1x1+c

RSS is cost

we will find RSS for all possible lines and which wil give least value, will be choosen as best fit line

------
we cannot use parabola or paranomial funcrions as it can result in over-fitting

Ordinary Least Square Method:

r-squared values

standarisation, outlier
-----

statsmodel, sklearn

r-square and adjusted r-square

r-square - variation in target varaible explianed by independent varaible
adj- rsquare - per unit change in r sqr when we add/remove single variable

f-statistics:

r-square shud be more - is accuracy


model accuracy fr this model - 71%

more than 3 features - hyper plane
