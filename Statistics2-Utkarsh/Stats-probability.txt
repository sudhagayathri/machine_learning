Random variable:


probabilty mass function:

representation x p(x) - separately seeing each 
easier to read

cumulative distribution function - cumulatively adding previous probabilties
here u cannot see unique probability

simple event- 
non -simple event -when more than 1 condition is involved
king + spade

sample event- collection of all possibel events

types of proability:
a. a priori classical - based on universal fact 
b. empirical - based on observed data - used in ml
c. subjective - based on persons past expereince - its very risky - not used in ml

mutually exclusive:
-----------
if two events cannot occur simulataneously

collectively exhaustive event:
-----------------
one of event must error
set of events cover entire sample space

Bayes Theorem:
----------
there s a classifier in ml and algorithm built on bayes theorem

multi condition probability - its extension of conditinal probability

---
Binomial distribution - works on probability of success and failure

multinomial dsitriibution - 
-------
poisson dsitriibution - at constant rate - if lambda is there
--
extra forecasting - time series forecasting
--------
ARIMA algorithms
Holts winter method algorithms
