NLP:
----------------
wherever text-data/words come in picture-nlp comes
nlp focuses on interaction btn computers & human language
it involves in development of algorithms that enables computers to interprets words, but also try to comprehend context around it
---------

use cases of nlp:
------------------
1. Text Classification - eg- categorizing  mail to social, spam
2. Sentimental Analysis - here also we do classification
3. Named Entity Recognition - extracting names, location, organizations etc
4. Machine Translation - 
5. Question Answerigng - chatbot, codex
6. Text Generation - generating content like author

is nlp part of ml or dl?
--------
it cud be part of either ml or dl
higher order models(dl)

OCR:
--------
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a popular technique used to extract data from scanned documents(images)


Steps of nlp:
----------------
break paragraphs to sentences -> sentencces into words -> break ur word - initial preprocessing,tokenizing
becoz machine doesnt understand words -> each word is converted to number - this is called vectorization
word2vec- higher level
ml use cases(string similarity) - anlaysing each word with context and meaning
	- boy ->girl, men -> women (understand context like human being)

stop words - words which are not providing any sense like - we are, unlike main words

common libraries to handle text data:
-----------
nltk
spacy
textblob



text pre -processing:
--------
here main word -> root word 

cleaning -> tokenization-> stop words removal -> pos(parts of speech) tagging -> NER(named entity recognition, like recognizing places,cities) -> stemming & lemmatization(convetng to root format)

text cleaning:
-------
1. remove special characters
2. lower casing
3. tokenization
4. remove stop words

stemming - process pf reducing base word to root word
stemming is very fast

stemmer:
--------
porter stemmer
lanchester stemmer

but it may end up giving meaningless word, it s so aggresive and doesn;t have dictionary

snowball stemmer is better

Lemmatizatoin: (also finds root word)
---------------
its more meaningful than stemming, it gives meaningful words
at backend it has dictionary of words

wordnetlemmatizer - mostly usd but slow - 
lancasterlemmatizer - lancasterlemmatizer - its faster but can produce non-dictionary words

--------------
basically for classificaiton we can use stemmer, for usecases whre we need acuuracy like transaltion, chatbot
we shud use lemmatization
-----------------
todo - scaling in ml model?

usecases:
-------
stemming - spam classificaton, review classification

lemmatizaton(where we cant cmpromise with meaning) - text summarization,lang transaltion, chatbots

Vectorisation or word embeddings:
----------------
process of converting tokens to numbers


text pre-processing steps:
--------------------
Text Data clening -> Tokenization -> Token Processing -> Vectroization


Text Data cleaning ->  removing punctuations, stop words

Tokenization -> breaking sentences/paragraphs to single word

Token Proessing -> pos, ner, stemming/lemmatization

basic nlp terminlogy:
------------
corpus    -> grp of sentences like a pragraph
Documents -> each sentence
Vocabulary -> dictionary containing unique word
words

methods of vectorization:
--------
one hot encoding
bag of words
tf-idf
word2vec


Disadvt of one hot encoding:
-----------------
out of vocabulary - any word not present in training data set,coming in testing, it wud fail to identify
creating lot no of columns 

to be checked:
------------
tagging ->sadha ->sudha


sadhb enterprises -> sudha enterprises 
subtokenization-> sentence piece tokeniza(dl
pyspellchecker
sadha hotel

sadha restaurant -> sadha hotel


amul - bmul



with multiple words

cafe coffee day -> spell mistakes


Latent semantic indexing
----------------------
 (also referred to as Latent Semantic Analysis) is a method of analyzing a set of documents in order to discover statistical co-occurrences of words that appear together which then give insights into the topics of those words and documents.

Two of the problems (among several) that LSI sets out to solve are the issues of synonymy and polysemy.

synonymy- how many words describe same meaning
polysemy - how many different meanings same word has
