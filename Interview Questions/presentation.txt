Slide 1:
-------
we have been given with in_drive coupon recommendatoin data
where people with different set of characteristics like age, marital status, driving with etc are given
And there are different coupon types- like Bar, coffee, restaurant is given

We have to classify whether the coupon will be accepted/not

EDA - Balnced data set:
-------
if data is imbaanced sampling techniques shud be applied 

Todo: sampling techniques

Missing values:
----------
can be done with -
1. either completely removing that row/column
2. by Imputation - by filling values
   for numerical - mean if no outlier/median
   for categorical- mode


Outlier treatment:
------
1. either by removing that data
2. Flooring or caption - replacing them with suitable value
    IQR:
    --
    Q1 = df1.quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = df1.quantile(0.75)
    iqr = Q3-Q1
    upper_fence= Q3+1.5*iqr
    lower_fence= Q1-1.5*iqr
    print('upper fence \n', upper_fence)
    print('\n lower fence \n', lower_fence)
    
    replacing with upper and lower fence
    
    z-score:
    ---
    #upper_fence=mean+3sd(standard deviaition)
    #lower_fence=mean-3sd(standard deviaition)


Univariate Analysis:
--------------
the graph tells 
    - what type of people are more in number, count
    - what is their acceptance per, classification
    
Ive plotted along with percentages so to get better inference

Copuon Distribution is not even required in snowy waeaher

coupon wise - Lot of coffee huse coupons is given ,---,bt ...this info adds value in decisoin making


bivariate analysis:
--
coupon_freq: this vlaue we got by feature_engineering , will see in next values
But its inference plays a huge role


Coorelatio of features:
--------
if 2 variable provide same information to the model, one of them can be removed
todo:


feature engineering:
--------

todo - one hot encoding

Model Building:
--
Now its ready for model building
