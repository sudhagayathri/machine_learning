---------
nlp questions

main voice to text conversation - detecting emotions
vox
whisper
board room questions
voice to text transformatin
-------
select_kbs

We shudnt balance the dataset at the very beginning, its eye wash
we shud check results, if it is not convinving only then it shud be done
and if we balance we shud do only on training data

feature_Selection approach

---------
inter questions:
--------
how auc graph is formed
logistic regression multiclass - one to all approach
grid search, randomised differrences, bayessian appraoch(cost effective
Gradient boosting

Pruning

minmaxscalerDeep pruning
N estimator
Svm
Overfitting, regularisation
Cross validation
Feature selection , pca
Random state, how it works
Chi square ,anova test
Bagging and boosting
Tf ydf matrix
Naive bayes
Ada booster working mathematical formula
Balance
-------------

reversea string without inbuilt
print no 1 to 10 list comprehension
randm forsrt both
adaptive boosting , gradient boostng
svc
k nearest neighbot
bias and variance trade off
svc what value gamma
dst role in knn
normalization vs standarization
full form of roc - receiver operating characteristics curve
data is inbalanced how random forest 
diff btn standarad deviation and variance

minmaxscaler

-------------------
why linear regression not suitable for classification
Assumption of logistic regression
If model is in underfitting if we use regularisation techniques
Can't use
Auc =0.5 

Palindrome
X=12345
Generators Map ,reduce, filter
Decorators
Left bit wise shift  operator 
List, insert an number at 500 index
Number 25 at 200 index

Hyper parameters in linear regression
Difference btn gradient boosting and gradient descent
Using learning rate its calculating global minima for one function

Anamoly detection
Pca
logloss

Distance algorithm -cosine algorithm

to check:
-------
Mathematical intuition of L1 and l2
